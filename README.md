This project shows the difference between the preserved feature set and the original set when doing encoding in tensorflow-keras.
In the comparison part, we use UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to downscale and visualize the data. 

**Usage:**

Upload to your personal colab folder and can run directly.

**Results:**

 The following figures are the result that set N as encoded feature number:
 
1. N = 128

2. N = 10
